###ON TO QUERYING!!!
#WITH PANDAS, you can take a small subset of the dataframe, run a filter or query on it, and then use that query to apply to other parts of the df

#output of this is a series containing the truth of falsehood of our query (###???) - THIS IS CALLED A mask

df['hour'] == 158

#now we want to apply a filter, using the mask to "index" into the dataframe to get the rows we want:
time = df[df['hour'] == 158]
time.head
time.shape

# queries can be based on multiple criteria using boolean operators â€” just add () around each condition. each condition creates a mask containing true and false values

df[(df['hour'] == 158) & (df['count'] < 50)]

# this dataset has now been substantially filtered, limited to single hour and limited to those cells with more than 50 GSP pings.

#how to specify a certain day?
bastille = df[df['date'] == '2017-07-14']
bastille.head

#which aggregated cells saw greater than average levels of activity?
bastille_enthusiasts = bastille[bastille['count'] > bastille['count'].mean()]
bastille_enthusiasts.head

# the .describe() method can be used to return a table that includes the count of non-null rows, their mean, standard dev, etc.
bastille_enthusiasts['count'].describe()

#what if we wanted to find summary stats for each day in July? use .groupby() method to collapse a dataframe on the values stored in a given column. out put is a table in which each row represents a table, and each column is a summary stat of the 'count' column
df.groupby('date')['count'].describe()

# group by multiple columns too! let's calculate summ stats for 'count' column for each hour of each day:

#you can also use built-in pandas methods to calculate individual summary stats
df['count'].max()
df['count'].min()
df['count'].mean()
df['count'].std()
df['count'].count()

#you can save these as variables! then cast them to strings!!
max_count = df['count'].max()
min_count = df['count'].min()
mean_count = df['count'].mean()

#now print those results:
print(f"Maximum number of GPS pings: {max_count}")
print(f"Minimum number of GPS pings: {min_count}")
print(f"Average number of GPS pings: {mean_count}")

#what if you're interested in returning all the other columns associated with those minimum and maximum values?

#there's a single row that contains the maximum alue of GPS pings.
df[df['count'] == df['count'].min()]
